## Description

Pandas is a Python framework for data analytics. In this lab, you'll work through three small projects that will illustrate what it can do. Along the way, we'll also learn a little
about Python-based plotting frameworks and review some statistical concepts.

By the end of this lab, you will be familiar with:

- Loading data from a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe.
- Basic dataframe manipulations: Selecting a column, selecting subsets, creating new columns.
- Generating cross tabulations and frequency tables for comparing categorical data.
- Creating bar plots from a frequency table.
- Creating histograms from a dataframe.
- Calculating the mean and five number summary of a dataframe.

At the end of this lab, you'll submit **three Python programs and three PDF plots** to the assignment on Canvas.

The three labs we're going to complete were originally designed by my wife for her book,
[*Project-Based R Companion to Introductory Statistics*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429292002/project-based-companion-introductory-statistics-chelsea-myers?context=ubx&refId=262ee6fc-50b7-4b79-a116-d508a2270467).
She has &ndash; let's call it &ndash; a *fascination* with weird and morbid 19th Century data sets, which is one of her many excellent qualities.
