## Due April 27

## Description

Answer the following questions below, which are all about connecting the content of this course to your broader education and long-term plans.

There are no right or wrong answers, but focus on interrogating your own experiences and bringing depth to your reflections. You can draw 
on any other experiences or sources that are helpful in answering the questions.

**Each of your answers should be a paragraph of at least four complete sentences**. Your entire set of answers will likely be 3-5 pages long.

## Questions

1. Think back to how you felt at the beginning of this course. What were your expectations?

2. Tell a story about a topic, problem, or assignment from the class that challenged you. How did you respond?

3. Tell a story about an interaction you had with another person because of this class.

4. Other than programming, what have you learned from this class that you can take forward into your other classes or post-Rollins work?

5. What has been your experience on learning during the pandemic, whether that was in-person or remote? What did you find most challenging? What (if anything)
worked well for you during this time?

6. What are your thoughts on online vs. in-person education? We will likely return to fully in-person instruction in the fall, but do you think there are positive aspects of online teaching that we should
incorporate into our regular face-to-face classes?

7. What are your thoughts on our specifications grading system? What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of specs grading? If you could design your own grading system what would it look like?

8. Thinking back on what we've learned this semester, what do you see as the **big idea** of the class &ndash; the thing that you'll be most likely to remember five, ten, or more years in the future?

9. *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. **The single most important skill you can develop in college is
self-awareness about your own learning process**. What have learned about your own learning during this entire year? **Write at least two paragraphs to answer this question**.
