## Office Hours
To better manage student interactions during the pandemic, I'm not planning to hold regular in-person office hours during the fall semester. While I'm on campus, my office will be the primary space where I can work without a mask, record videos, eat, etc. Therefore, I think it's wise to limit the number of students coming in and out of my office each day, at least at the beginning of the semester while we're all adjusting to new patterns of working and interacting.

Most informal class-related questions will be handled over Slack. I'll send out details for how to join our class workspace in the first week of the semester. I will also handle most casual advising questions over Slack.

If you'd like to chat in person, we can talk (in a socially-distanced way) at the beginning or end of class. You can also make an appointment to chat via WebEx if you have questions that are too in-depth to handle over Slack.

I will plan to be generally available for WebEx appointments on

- Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00
- Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:00 to 3:00

## Official Course Description

**CMS 120 Introduction to Computer Science**. Introduction to fundamental aspects of programming using a high-level language, focusing on problem solving, software design concepts, and their realization as computer programs. Topics include: variables, using existing classes, selection and iteration, and arrays. Classroom activities are used to gain mastery of these principles. Co-requisite: CMS 195L

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will

1. Be able to write programs using core features of the Python language, including variables, conditionals, functions, and loops.

2. Write programs using Python's built-in list and dictionary data structures.

2. Be familiar with the principles of object-oriented programming and the use of classes in organizing programs.

3. Be able to write programs that conform to a written specification and are evaluated using automated testing.

4. Understand and use methods of sound program design, such as abstraction and stepwise refinement, to design solutions to open-ended
programming problems.

5. Read and comprehend program source code.

6. Be familiar with common terminology from computer science and programming.

7. Be familiar with the fundamentals of computer organization, systems, and data representation.

## Labs

This class has a co-requisite of CMS 120L Introduction to Computer Science Lab.

We'll complete a total of **six** hypothesis-based lab activities during the semester; the other lab periods are available to practice programming and work on assignments. 

Together, CMS 120 and 120L may substitute for the required **rFLA 200-level Science class**, which reduces the number of 200-level classes you need to complete to satisfy your rFLA requirements. I'll talk about how to do this later in the semester.

CMS 120 and the lab are listed as separate sections but you'll receive the **same grade** for both. Completing the six required labs is one component of your final grade, discussed below.

## Textbook

There is one required **free** online text, *Think Python* by Allen Downey. It’s available on the web at https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/. Note that we're using the **second edition** of the book, which covers **Python 3**. The older version that covers Python 2 is **not** what you want.

We will also use Mimir as an online development and automatic grading platform. It's free for the 2020-21 academic year. Please plan to sign up for Mimir by the start of the first lab. I'll send out the details of how to connect your Mimir account to the class by e-mail.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Labs
You must be registered for a section of CMS 120L. You'll receive the **same grade** for both CMS 120 and CMS 120L.

### Assignments
We'll have five kinds of assignments in this class:

1. A set of **seven autograded programming assignments**. These will be done on the Mimir platform, and you'll have one due approximately every two weeks. Each assignment consists of questions that will require you to write short Python programs, accompanied by tests that automatically evaluate your code.

2. **Six short quizzes** that will be taken **in class** on the days specified on the calendar.

3. A set of **six required labs** that will be done in class on the days specified on the calendar. These labs emphasize data collection and scientific reasoning and are required for this class to count for the RFLA Science requirement. The other lab periods will be used for extra practice and working on the problem sets.

4. A **final project**, which will be your chance to choose and implement any program that you want using the features we've studied in the course.

5. **Challenge projects**, which are optional extra credit and can be used to raise your grade.

There are **no exams** in this class.

### Satisfactory Credit

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. "Satisfactory" means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

### The Giant Pile of Points

Each homework assignment and quiz will consist of a number of questions, with the typical assignment having about five questions and each quiz having four. Your final letter grade will be based on the total number of **questions** that you answer correctly over the course of the semester.

For each question on the programming assignments, **you'll receive credit if your code passes all of the autograded tests** for that question.

For the quizzes, I will award you credit for each question based on the "substantially complete and correct" standard described above.

Therefore, at the end of the semester, you'll have accumulated a number of points based on your overall performance on all of the quizzes and programming assignments. There will be **approximately** 60 points from homework and quiz questions allocated during the semester.

Note that there is **no partial credit**: You will always receive either **full credit** for a satisfactory answer to a question or **no credit**.


### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following criteria:

1. Earn at least 90% of the total points from homework and quiz questions over the course of the semester.

2. Complete a satsifactory final programming project.

3. Complete all six of the required laboratory reports.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| For               | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Earning credit for less than 90% of the total homework and quiz question points | Fraction of a letter grade (e.g. B to B-)       |
| Earning credit for less than 85%, 80%, etc. of the total homework and quiz points| Fraction of a letter grade for each 5%       |                   
| Each incomplete lab report | Fraction of a letter grade |
| Unsatisfactory final project               | A full letter grade (e.g. B to C) |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you failed to satisfactorily complete two lab reports, your base grade would be lowered by two fractions of a letter, from B to C+.

### Challenge Projects

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional **challenge projects** that show deeper engagement with the course material. There will be at least **three challenge
projects** and all of the projects are due on the final day of class. Satisfactory completion of a challenge project will raise your grade by **a fraction of a letter**, e.g. B to B+.

**To earn an A**, you need to complete the requirements for a B plus all three challenge projects.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

4. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

5. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### I Feel Decidedly Uncomfortable

This is probably a new approach to grading for you. In particular, students new to specs grading often have anxiety about the lack of partial credit in the system.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. **You don't have to be perfect**. The "substantially complete and correct" standard allows for imperfections in your answers and you only need 90% of the available question points over the semester, so you don't have to correctly answer, or even attempt, every programming problem or quiz question.

2. **You do need to be consistent**. The system rewards you for putting forward good, consistent effort. Working diligently and carefully will allow you to accumulate all of the points that you need for a B.

3. **You will get lots of feedback**. The autograded tests will tell you, unambiguously, whether your answers for a programming question are correct or not. The standards for the final project and the lab reports will likewise be transparent.

4. **Some work will be done in class**. Completing the six required labs is easy if you attend class during the lab periods.

5. **You have extra credit options**. One of the challenge projects will be a short reflective writing assignment that won't be difficult to complete.

## COVID Policies

The College's COVID-19 prevention policies will apply to all of our class meetings. We'll wear masks and sit in assigned seats for the duration of the semester.

If you are registered to attend the class in-person, **you must attend in-person**. Excepting cases of illness or quarantine, **in-person students may not unoffically switch to virtual attendance** and may not choose how to attend on a day-by-day basis. If you are registered to attend in-person and need to switch permanently to virtual attendance, there will be a procedure for you to make an official transition.

## Other Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet. **Don't attend class if you're sick**.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

It is acceptable to discuss questions and solutions in general terms with other class members, but your discussions should not be at a level of detail that would lead to you submitting the same work as a another student.

Office	of	Accessibility	Services,	located	on	the	first	floor	of	the	Olin	Library,	as	soon	
as	possible. You	are	encouraged	to	schedule	a	Welcome	Meeting	by	filling	out	
the “First	Time	Users” form	on	the	website: https://www.rollins.edu/accessibilityservices and/or	reach	out	by	phone	or	email: 407-975-6463 or Access@Rollins.edu.

All	test-taking	accommodations	requested	for	this	course	must	first	be	approved	
through	the	Office	of	Accessibility	Services (OAS)	and	scheduled	online	through	
Accommodate at	least	72	hours	before	the	exam.	Official	accommodation	letters	
must	be	received	by	and	discussed	with	the	faculty	in	advance.	 There	will	be	no	
exceptions	given	unless	previously	approved	by	the	OAS with	documentation	of	the	
emergency	situation.	We	highly	recommend	making	all	testing	accommodations	at	
the	beginning	of	the	semester.	OAS staff	are	available	to	assist	with	this	process.

### Citation	Expectations
As	per	the	Academic	Honor	Code,	plagiarism	is	defined	as	“Offering the words, facts,
or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise.” In	order	to	avoid	
plagiarism,	all	students	are	expected	to	use	proper	citation	norms.	For	our	course,	
all	assignments	will	use	[faculty	choice	- MLA,	Chicago,	APA,	etc]	citation	style.	

### Absences	– Religious	Holidays	and/or	Campus	Business
The	professor	will	accommodate	a	reasonable	number	of	excused	absences	for	
religious	holidays	and	official	off-campus	college	business	such	as	academic	
conference	presentations	and	athletic	competitions.	However,	per	the	College’s	
policy	on	excused	absences	
(http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic_regulations.html#class-attendance),	
students	must	discuss	with	the	professor	the	dates	of	the	anticipated	absences	no	
later	than	the	last	day	of	the	drop	period.	Students	must	present	to	their	professor	
written	evidence	of	the	anticipated	absences	and	discuss	with	him/her	how	and	
when	make-up	work	should	be	completed	prior	to	missing	the	class.	Students	
should	not	expect	to	receive	allowance	for	excused	absences	if	they	do	not	meet	
with	the	professor	beforehand	and	clarify	the	dates	as	necessary.	Absences	will	be	
addressed	by	the	faculty	member	in	accordance	with	his/her	attendance	policy.	The	
professor	retains	the	right	to	determine	what	would	be	considered	to	be	a	
reasonable	number	of	absences	(excused	or	otherwise)	for	the	course.	A	student	
will	not	fail	a	course	because	the	number	of	religious	observances	and/or	college	
business	absences	exceed	the	number	of	absences	allowed,	except	if	excessive	
absences	make	it	impossible	to	fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	course.	The	student’s	
class	participation	grade	in	the	course,	though,	may	still	be	affected.

### Credit	Hour	Statement	for	Rollins	Courses
This	course	is	a	four-credit-hour	course	that	meets	three	hours	per	week.	The	value	
of four	credit	hours	results,	in	part,	from	work	expected	of	enrolled	students	both	
inside	and	outside	the	classroom. Rollins	faculty	require	that	students	average	at	
least	2	½	hours	of	outside	work	for	every	hour	of	scheduled	class	time. In	this	
course,	the	additional	outside-of-class	expectations	are	reading and substantial programming projects
in our online programming environment.

### Recording	Device Use
In	order	to	protect	the	integrity	of	the	classroom	experience,	the	use	of	recording	
devices	is	limited	to	either	the	expressed	permission	of	the	faculty	member	or	with
